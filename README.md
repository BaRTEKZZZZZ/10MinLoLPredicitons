Data cleaning, feature engineering and machine learning models 

Created for SDA final project


Project uses data from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min

League of Legends is a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) where 2 teams (blue and red) face off. There are 3 lanes, a jungle, and 5 roles. The goal is to take down the enemy Nexus to win the game.

This project's purpose was to create machine learning model able to predict result of the match based on the data available at 10 min gametime. This could be usefull tool for players when deciding on which objective focus in the first minutes to maximize chances of winning.
